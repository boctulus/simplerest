    },
    "error": "",
    "error_detail": ""
}

	GET /api/v1/products?props=count(*) as cant
	

Or with an alias

	GET /api/v1/products?size=1L&props=avg(cost) as media

# Grouping

	GET /api/v1/products?props=count(*) as cant&groupBy=size&fields=size

Example of Response:

{
    "data": [
        {
            "size": "",
            "cant": "21"
        },
        {
            "size": "0.5L",
            "cant": "2"
        },
        ...
    ],
    "error": "",
    "error_detail": ""
}

Note: when groupBy is used, you should specify the fields to be selected.
