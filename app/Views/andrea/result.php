        <div class="testoa" style="color: #7C5039;">“Vegetables are gross,” Pablo says looking at a plate of innocent string beans.<br>Every night the same story: Mommy Bozzolo is tired of repeating, “don’t say ‘gross’, vegetables are good for you.”<br>“I’m not hungry!” the child answers, crossing his arms.</div>
        <div class="testob" style="color: #7C5039;">“There must be a green that you like, right?” Bozzolo asks wearily.<br>Pablo thinks of tasteless zucchini.<br>“Vegetables are super-gross!” he repeats, moving the plate aside.<br>Mommy Bozzolo looses her patience and sends him to bed.</div>

        <div class="testoa" style="color: #9F272B;">It is really true: you cannot go to bed when you are sad.<br>Pablo tosses and turns a million times. He cannot sleep, his stomach is grumbling too much. He tries closing his eyes…<br>…but when he opens them again, his little room has become a garden!</div>
        <div class="testob" style="color: #9F272B;">He pinches himself, tries to pull herself together, but he keeps seeing grass, blue sky and big rectangles of soil so soft and inviting that he feels like plunging his hands into it.<br>It is cool and comforting, and it gives him pleasure.</div>

        <div class="tale-text text-tale-shadow">
        <div class="testoa" style="color: #144E59;">Suddenly he hears a strange noise.<br>He looks around and realizes he is not alone. Something is moving among the leaves… someone is hopping and skipping!<br>He approaches warily. “What do we have here?” he asks in awe.</div>
        <div class="testob" style="color: #144E59;">The strange creatures have heard him; they stop and turn suddenly.<br>They are everywhere!<br>“Hello,” they say in unison, “what’s your name?”<br>“I’m Pablo,” the child answers, wide-eyed. “You can talk! Who are you?”</div>

        <div class="tale-text text-tale-shadow">
        <div class="testoa" style="color: #9F272B;">“Who are we? We are the gnomes of the veggie garden,” they answer all together. “Pleased to meet you.”<br>“I never heard of the gnomes of the veggie garden,” Pablo says pensively. “Do you have a cartoon on TV?”</div>
        <div class="testob" style="color: #9F272B;">“No way! We are real, don’t you see?” says the one who looks like their leader, “and we have an important task: it is thanks to us if man has learned to farm all the wonderful vegetables that grow on this Earth.”<br>But Pablo does not agree. “Yuck!” he exclaims. “Vegetables are gross!”</div>

        <div class="tale-text text-tale-shadow">
        <div class="testoa" style="color: #9F272B;">A silence descends.<br>This case is harder than the gnomes expected: it needs a special intervention.<br>The gnomes exchange quick, knowing looks.<br>“FORMATION!” the leader hollers ominously.</div>
        <div class="testob" style="color: #9F272B;">Then the music starts, and the gnomes burst into a wild rap.<br>Now Pablo is really speechless.<br>And here he thought they were about to scold him like Mommy!<br>“These gnomes are cool!” he enthuses. He was not expecting such a show.</div>

        <div class="testoa" style="color: #144E59;">“Don’t think these are fables or just words in a song,”<br>the gnomes repeat, pirouetting to their hands’ beat.<br>Pablo watches them, amused. Veggies are gross, but these guys are truly special.</div>
        <div class="testob" style="color: #144E59;">“Now come on, let’s make haste, you’ll find veggies galore<br>that appeal to your taste, you will love them for sure!”<br>The gnomes applaude their own final verse, then they hop and skip toward the colorful vegetable gardens. Their leader invites Pablo to follow him.</div>

        <div class="tale-text text-tale-shadow">
        <div class="testoa" style="color: #375741;">They reach the corn field, where the towering plants show big bundles of leaves with a tuft on the top.<br>The leader takes a bundle and opens it, explaining: “These here are the cobs that hold the corn together. Did you know that popcorn is actually made of these kernels?”</div>
        <div class="testob" style="color: #375741;">Pablo is surprised. “From the cob?” he asks incredously. “Isn’t popcorn made by the machine at the movie-theater?”<br>The gnomes burst out laughing. The movie-theater? Really, this kid is too much.</div>

        <div class="tale-text text-tale-shadow">
        <div class="testoa" style="color: #9F272B;">The visit continues through the potato field.<br>A few of the gnomes start rummaging among the dirt clumps.<br>“What are you doing?” Pablo asks, intrigued.<br>“They are working,” the leaden explains. “This is how you harvest potatoes.”</div>
        <div class="testob" style="color: #9F272B;">But to him this looks like a wonderful game. It’s a treasure hunt: the one who finds the biggest potato is the winner!<br>So he joins in the search, and he can’t help but think how much he likes french fries.</div>

        <div class="tale-text text-tale-shadow">
        <div class="testoa" style="color: #375741;">They come to the rectangle of squash.<br>It is still summer, so the little plants are quite young.<br>“Every season has its own vegetables to harvest,” say some she-gnomes, “and these pumpkins are all reserved for Halloween.”</div>
        <div class="testob" style="color: #375741;">Then the leader gives him some biscuits.<br>“These are made with squash,” he tells him.<br>Pablo takes a cookie, he studies it warily,<br>sniffs it, then he takes the smallest bite.<br>“Amazing, I like it!” He gives it a big bite. “It’s really quite good!”</div>

        <div class="tale-text text-tale-shadow">
        <div class="testoa" style="color: #9A412B;">The red-spotted garden is a riot of tomatoes.<br>Each single flower will soon become a juicy little fruit.<br>“And each tomato contains the seeds that we will plant next year to have a new harvest,” the leader says.<br>“This is magic!” Pablo exclaims in awe.</div>
        <div class="testob" style="color: #9A412B;">“The real magic it what Mother Nature does,” another gnome interjects, offering him a handful of seeds. “Everything comes from here: you just need a good patch of earth, water, sun and a little love. Because the plants can hear you, did you know that?” Pablo shakes his head: no, he did not know that. To think of all the times he has badmouthed them!</div>

        <div class="testoa" style="color: #983E29;">When morning light awakens him, Pablo opens his eyes and realizes he is back in his room. Everything else has vanished.<br>“It was just a dream,” he murmurs disappointedly.<br>Yet there is something in his hand: seeds!<br>“Mommeee!” he hollers excitedly.</div>
        <div class="testob" style="color: #983E29;">Pablo runs to Mommy Bozzolo.<br>He is thrilled, and he babbles on about singing gnomes who grow corn, pumpkins and tomatoes. “…And everything is so good for you! I thought that veggies came from the grocery store. Well, Mommy, that’s not true!”<br></div>

        <div class="testoa" style="color: #388887;">“And the gnomes told you all this?”<br>The child nods, and Bozzolo makes a mental note to thank them.<br>Then Pablo grows all serious and whispers that, well, he still doesn’t like string beans, but that there is a lot of other vegetables he could eat. “Like pumpkin cookies, Mommy!”</div>
        <div class="testob" style="color: #388887;">“All right,” his mother smiles,“ to each his own. We just have to find out what you like.” Then she admits that she, for one, could never stand peas.<br>“I hate peas!” she says forcefully.<br>But Pablo reproaches her.<br>“Shhh! Lower your voice,” he says, “they might hear you!”</div>

        <div class="testoa" style="color: #9A412B;">Pablo shows his Mom the treasure in his hand.<br>“A gnome gave me these seeds. They might become a vegetable that I like.”<br>“Then we have to find out if they do,” Bozzolo says.</div>
        <div class="testob" style="color: #9A412B;">Alas, the look on his son’s face is disconsolate. “We are not gnomes, Mommy. We don’t have rectangles of earth. We don’t even have a garden!”<br>But now Mommy Bozzolo has an idea. “We do have something: ever heard of a balcony veggie patch?”</div>
